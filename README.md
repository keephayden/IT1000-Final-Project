Hello, I am a student enrolled at the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/). I am majoring in **Information Technology**. Growing up, i was somewhat of a *math wiz* and always knew the solution to a computer or anything thats technology. I am very curious to see what my [future]() holds with a degree from Mizzou.

## Coding
Preparing for college and trying to understand a concept new to me was very motivating. I had never actually done coding, but i had  heard from all around that not only is it pretty understanding, but everyone should learn how to. So why not just go into the field of it? Not only is it cool to learn and fun to do, but nothing is better than the feeling of creating something on a computer that runs on its own. [Click here to see what I have done with coding.]()

## Markdown
Previously I have had to do a [markdown project](). It was honestly one of my favorite because it was easier than i thought to create so much in such little time. The way it is set up with how to create bold words, tables, lists, etc. is very organized and satisfying to see appear.
