# Basketball in My Life

## Starting Off
I started playing when I was about in 3rd grade and stopped until about my first year in junior high school. It was always fun, but I knew i needed to work on my game more to get to where I wanted to be.
___
#### Things I worked on
* My ball handling
 * Did things like [**dribble drills**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K0rlzOXOZY "Dribble drills")
 * I watched what the pros would do.
* Work on my jump shot
 * I would try to shoot _about_ 1000 shots a day to get my form memorized mechanically
* Work on my cardio and health
 * I needed to because I was a big kid in that time and i needed good cardio to keep running from one end of the court to the other.
   * Food and diet was important with reaching progress with this as well

 #### How I Based My Diet
 |  Macros       |  Amounts  |
 | ------------- | --------- |
 | Carbohydrates |    20%    |
 |     Fats      |    40%    |
 |    Protein    |    40%    |

### How This Worked Day by Day
 1. **Monday/Wednesday/Friday**: I would do cardio, so i'd have to eat more amounts of calories but in same range of percentages.
 2. **Tuesday/Thursdays**: Same goes if I lift, or if i do both in a single day. Id have to increase amount of calories.
 3. **Saturday**: I would have this day to focus on my skills and abilities for basketball.
  * This i'd consider being cardio, so my intake would be similar to # 1.
 4. **Sunday**: I would use this day to recover from all the work i had put in to prepare for the next week.
  * As far as intake of food I would only eat just the amount if I was to maintain what I had.

### Why I talk about this?
This story helps me with understanding how I can take my work ethic in basketball, into coding. I never would have thought that I'd be learning how to so quickly . Not only that, but I enjoy it as well. Something i've learned :
 ```Python
   do_calculation = True
   while (do_calculation):
   another_calculation = input("perform another calculation? (y/n): ")
    if (another_calculation != "y"):
         do_calculation = False
```
I hope to continue to enjoy this career path and keep use of wanting to do better more and more as I go along. I Thank you for teaching me the things that i've laerned and cant wait to learn more. [Fin](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/spanish-english/fin).
